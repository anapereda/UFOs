# UFO's

In this project we developed a web application using javasript and html. The webpage displays a brief history about Ufology and its meaning. 
Using java script we integrated a dynamic table fed by a database stored in a .js file. There are five categories to which the table can be filtered to; thus when we enter a filter in the input boxes the table will automatically change to show only those characteristics stated in the filter. 
In the future, we could do a dropbox with a single box that included filter category and filter respectively. We could also prepare other queries that reponded to demands like linking to real sotries or directions to get to places where the UFOs sightseeing occur.
